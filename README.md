# Mastermind - Guess the code
Available 'colors' are: 1,2,3,4,5,6.
The code consists of a combination of 4 unique colors.
You can guess 10 times before the game is over.
Input your guess like this: '1234'.

After each guess the computer returns how many items were guessed correct (this is indicated by a '2')
and how many colors were guessed correct but had an incorrect position. (this is indicated by a '1').
So if you get [2, 2, 2, 2] the guess was correct.
If you guess the code within 10 tries, you win!
